    <h1>Kata: Gravity Flip</h1>
    <p>
        If you've completed this kata already and want a bigger challenge, here's the <br>
        3D version<br>
        <br>
        Bob is bored during his physics lessons so he's built himself a toy box to help <br>
        pass the time. The box is special because it has the ability to change gravity.<br>
        <br>
        There are some columns of toy cubes in the box arranged in a line. The i-th column <br>
        contains a_i cubes. At first, the gravity in the box is pulling the cubes downwards. <br>
        When Bob switches the gravity, it begins to pull all the cubes to a certain side <br>
        of the box, d, which can be either 'L' or 'R' (left or right). Below is an example <br>
        of what a box of cubes might look like before and after switching gravity.<br>
        <br>
        +---+                                       +---+<br>
        |   |                                       |   |<br>
        +---+                                       +---+<br>
        +---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+<br>
        |   ||   |     |   |   -->        |   ||   ||   |<br>
        +---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+<br>
        +---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+<br>
        |   ||   ||   ||   |         |   ||   ||   ||   |<br>
        +---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+<br>
        <br>
        Given the initial configuration of the cubes in the box, find out how many cubes are <br>
        in each of the n columns after Bob switches the gravity.<br>
        <br>
        Examples (input -> output:<br>
        <br>
        * 'R', [3, 2, 1, 2]      ->  [1, 2, 2, 3]<br>
        * 'L', [1, 4, 5, 3, 5 ]  ->  [5, 5, 4, 3, 1]<br>
